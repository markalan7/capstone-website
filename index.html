    <div class="row section" id="FAQ">
      <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <p class="faq-question"><strong>What are the school's expectations for this project?</strong></p>
        <p>
          We expect the project to be doable in 15 weeks. We want projects that touch on at least three areas of computer science (for example, databases, web programming, and operating systems). In the end, we hope the students create something that can usable. The project must be designed so that within several weeks the students understand the problem and can begin to make progress. Remember these students are taking a full-load of classes and can only dedicate about 10 hours per week per team member.  For example, in one term, one team was assigned to modify a large program. It took more than half the semester before the team and the mentor became aware that the project wasn't doable in the time frame.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question"><strong>What is the timeframe involved?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Typically a group of 2-3 students is assigned to a term long project (15 week term). The students expect to average about 10 hours per week on the project.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question"><strong>What are the students' deliverables?</strong></p>
        <p>
          The students are required to give two presentations. The first one, 2-4 weeks into the term, describes their project and the goals they want to accomplish. The final presentation (during finals week) describes what was accomplished. The students are also responsible for writing up a proposal and a final report.  Lastly, students should give a demo (if appropriate) of their work.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question"><strong>What are the expectations for the Mentor?</strong></p>
        <p>
          The first week of class the Mentors come to campus and present their projects/ideas. The students rank the projects based on their interests. The project coordinator (1680/1640 instructor) assigns the teams based on their interests. Once the teams are assigned, the mentor will work with them on a weekly basis to keep them on track. Some mentors choose to come to campus one day a week to meet with their team (the class is scheduled for MWF 1-2PM so the students are available at these times, but other times can/should be arranged at the convenience of all) others interact through email/skype/wiki/socialnetworks where appropriate. The mentors are invited to the final presentations and give feedback to me concerning the grade to be assigned.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-question"><strong>What are the expectations for disclosure of a company's sensitive information?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Typically, the students are not given access to sensitive information.  The company should sanitize any sensitive information before providing it to the students, since it is hard to agree within a reasonable time frame on the terms of any NDA.</p>
        <p class="faq-question"><strong>Can the student act as a team member or is the expectation that he or she is the Team Lead for this activity?</strong></p>
        <p>
          The team members each take on a role (e.g., specification designer, developer, tester) but the mentor is the Team Leader.
